The requirements for this project ask you to use the skills and technologies youâ€™ve learned over the past six weeks (server-side JavaScript, RESTful APIs, databases, object-relational mapping, environment variables, templating, and authentication).

By 2023, there will be over 27 Million Software Developers. That is less than 0.5% of the world's population. But, there is a need for coders. Our world is changing and there is a race to keep up with technology and client needs. In any community, the best of the best encourage and support new members by sharing best practices, discussing trial and error efforts, and answering the questions that start with "How do I...?" Whether you are new or have years of expertise, there has been a time when you thought, "how do I get this done?" If there was a place for you to search for "just the best" you would stumble upon {COD}EZ.community! The best "tips database" where users can view and submit tips they've picked up along the way. Are you faster? Smarter? Agile? Submit a tip and change the way the world codes.

**Team Note**
>The name {COD}EZ.community is designed this way to JOIN the words CODE+EASY. In some training and development environments the term EZ is a reference to a database of knowledge. Because this would be sourced from the coder community exclusively it became {COD}EZ.community.

**AS A** coder,
**I WANT TO** find the best tips,
**SO THAT** I can code smarter, with confidence.

# <a name="Process-and-Roles"> Process and Roles </a>
Our team divided everything into "Front-End" and "Back-End" for the initial stage of development. Then once each end was set up, we began creating processes that tied the front-end to the back-end, and vice versa. Here is how we divided the roles and responsibilities:

**Front-End Roles**
- Wireframe - Ballard
- Display - Casandra
- HTML Pages - Cassandra
- Framework - Cassandra

**Back-End Roles**
- Models - Ballard and Ramu
- Routes - Ballard and Ramu
- Schema and Seeds - Ballard
- Login - Ramu
- Server - Ramu
- Handlebars - Shaun and Ramu

**Teamwork Note:**
>The roles assigned above are associated with owners, but a lot of what we've done was collaborative. Example: We would test a function or style and ensure the team was onboard with it. It was not uncommon to have someone assigned to work on Back-End to provide feedback for Front-End, or vice versa.

# <a name="Technology-Library"> Technology Library </a>
This bootcamp challenge required that we use some existing technology, but also incorporate technology that we have not went over in class. Here is the comprehensive list of what we used to build our application:

**Required Technology**
- Node.JS
- Express.JS
- Handlebars.JS
- MySQL
- Sequelize

**Extra Technology**
- Body-Parser
- Connect-Redis
- Connect-Session-Sequelize
- Cookie Parser
- Express-Form-Data
- Express-Session
- HTTP (Security Package)
- Multer
- Passport
- Passport-Facebook
- Passport-Github2
- Passport-Local
- UUID

**Technology Note:**
>Our challenged asked that we only include one (1) extra technology. Once we began our concept wireframe and file directory we realized that we would need way more than one (1). And with what we want to do next, we will need a lot more.

# <a name="Wins-and-Opportunities"> Wins and Opportunities </a>
This challenge presented a few opportunities for us, but we dove in headfirst and came out with several wins. What made this possible was our Agile workflow. We checked in each other frequently and collaborated well.

**Wins**
- Facebook Registration and Login
- GitHub Reginstation and Login
- Concept Design and Implementation - Speed
- Routing
- Git Merging and Development

**Opportunities**
- Handlebar Implementation
- Framework Formatting for Future Dev

**Team Note**
>We believe that even our opportunities, although challenging, make this application better. We worked tirelessly to ensure that very little was left on the "development table."

We created a list of "Future Development" ideas that we pulled from the original concept. Here are those ideas:

**Future Dev List**
- Tip Ranking
- Individual Language Pages
- Submit a Language
- Submit Tips with Media Files
- Become a Verified User
- Search for a Tip with Tags
- Featured Tips Page
- Tip Comments
- And more...

**Team Note**
>Yes! This was actually all in the original concept idea, but once we realzied how large this project would be and how little time we had, we had to "cut the fat." We strongly believe that this site is not like anything done before. Most sites follow a simple Q&A concept. The last thing you want as a coder is to take bad code or code hard to interpret and put it into your project wasting your time. The Future Development list would be nice to work on at some point.
